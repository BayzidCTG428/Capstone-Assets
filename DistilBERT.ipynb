        "### 1. **Transformers (`from transformers import ...`)**\n",
        "- **Library**: `transformers`\n",
        "- **Task**: This library is developed by Hugging Face and provides pre-trained transformer models (like BERT, GPT, etc.) for various NLP tasks.\n",
        "  - **`DistilBertForSequenceClassification`**: A model for sequence classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, spam detection) based on the DistilBERT architecture, a smaller and faster variant of BERT.\n",
        "  - **`DistilBertTokenizer`**: A tokenizer that converts text into a format suitable for input into the DistilBERT model.\n",
        "  - **`Trainer` and `TrainingArguments`**: High-level APIs for training and evaluating transformer models, handling many of the complexities of model training.\n",

        "### 3. **pandas (`import pandas as pd`)**\n",
        "- **Library**: `pandas`\n",
        "- **Task**: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames to handle and process structured data. It's essential for tasks like reading data from files, cleaning data, transforming it, and performing statistical analysis.\n",
