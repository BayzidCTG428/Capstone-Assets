Here is a breakdown of what each library is used for and the tasks they perform:\n","\n","### 1. **Transformers (`from transformers import ...`)**\n","- **Library**: `transformers`\n","- **Task**: This library is developed by Hugging Face and provides pre-trained transformer models (like BERT, GPT, etc.) for various NLP tasks.\n","  - **`DistilBertForSequenceClassification`**: A model for sequence classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, spam detection) based on the DistilBERT architecture, a smaller and faster variant of BERT.\n","  - **`DistilBertTokenizer`**: A tokenizer that converts text into a format suitable for input into the DistilBERT model.\n","  - **`Trainer` and `TrainingArguments`**: High-level APIs for training and evaluating transformer models, handling many of the complexities of model training.\n","\n","### 2. **Datasets (`from datasets import ...`)**\n","- **Library**: `datasets`\n","- **Task**: A library also developed by Hugging Face that provides tools to load, preprocess, and manage large datasets efficiently.\n","  - **`load_dataset`**: Loads pre-defined datasets or custom datasets for training and evaluation.\n","  - **`DatasetDict`**: A dictionary-like object to store and manipulate multiple datasets (e.g., training, validation, and test datasets).\n","\n","### 3. **pandas (`import pandas as pd`)**\n","- **Library**: `pandas`\n","- **Task**: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames to handle and process structured data. It's essential for tasks like reading data from files, cleaning data, transforming it, and performing statistical analysis.\n","\n","### 4. **NumPy (`import numpy as np`)**\n","- **Library**: `numpy`\n","- **Task**: A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions. It is used here likely for numerical operations, data manipulation, or preparing data for machine learning models.\n","\n","### 5. **spaCy (`import spacy`)**\n","- **Library**: `spacy`\n","- **Task**: An advanced NLP library used for text processing. It can perform tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and more. It is used to preprocess and analyze text data.\n","\n","### 6. **TensorFlow and Keras (`import tensorflow as tf`, `from tensorflow import keras`)**\n","- **Library**: `tensorflow` and `keras` (which is integrated within TensorFlow)\n","- **Task**: TensorFlow is a deep learning framework used for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python, that is tightly integrated with TensorFlow.\n","  - **`tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text.one_hot`**: Encodes text into integer indices (one-hot encoding), useful for text preprocessing.\n","  - **`tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences`**: Pads sequences of integers to ensure they all have the same length, which is often required when feeding text into neural networks.\n","\n","### 7. **scikit-learn (`from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`)**\n","- **Library**: `scikit-learn`\n","- **Task**: A library for machine learning in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.\n","  - **`train_test_split`**: Splits the data into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.\n","  - **`classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`**: Functions to evaluate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and to visualize model performance with a confusion matrix.\n","\n","### 8. **Seaborn (`import seaborn as sns`)**\n","- **Library**: `seaborn`\n","- **Task**: A data visualization library based on `matplotlib` that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It is often used for visualizing the confusion matrix or other model evaluation metrics.\n","\n","### Summary of Tasks:\n","- **Data Preparation and Manipulation**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `datasets`, `spaCy`, `scikit-learn`\n","- **Text Processing and NLP**: `transformers`, `spaCy`, `tensorflow.keras`\n","- **Model Training and Evaluation**: `transformers`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `scikit-learn`\n","- **Visualization**: `seaborn`\n","\n","These libraries work together to enable end-to-end development of machine learning and NLP models, from data preprocessing and manipulation to model building, training, and evaluation."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"mO_d22dv6svB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733239798171,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":33063,"user":{"displayName":"45-082-Bayzid
